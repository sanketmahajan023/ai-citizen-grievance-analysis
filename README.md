## Government & Public Sector - AI-Driven Citizen Grievance & Sentiment Analysis System

🚧 Project Status

Ongoing Internship Project - Week 1 Completed

This project in week1 is part of an internship program focused on analyzing large-scale service request data using Natural Language Processing(NLP), Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA). 

🎯 Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze citizen grievance data using Natural Language Processing(NLP) techniques to extract meaningful insights and sentiment patterns.
